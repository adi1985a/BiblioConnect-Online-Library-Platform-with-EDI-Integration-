# BiblioConnect: Online Library with EDI

## Overview
BiblioConnect is a Laravel-based online library platform designed for students, enabling book browsing, borrowing, and electronic data interchange (EDI).

- **EDI Integration**: Uses EDI standards (e.g., EDIFACT) for efficient data exchange (borrowing, returns, fees).
- **Search and Filter**: Search books by title, author, category, or rating; filter results.
- **Notifications**: Sends email reminders for due dates and electronic invoices for fees.
- **User History**: View borrowing history, fees, and online catalog with ratings/reviews.
- **Security**: Implements CSRF tokens, password hashing, XSS prevention, and SQL injection protection.
- **Responsive UI**: Adapts to desktops, tablets, and smartphones using Bootstrap.
- **Community Features**: Add reviews, ratings, and comments; share book recommendations.
- **User Management**: Register, log in, and manage profiles (personal details, password).

- Built with Laravelâ€™s MVC, repository, and dependency injection patterns.
- Security: CSRF tokens, hashed passwords, XSS/SQL injection prevention.
- Placeholder pages (e.g., book list table) need implementation.
- EDI integration (e.g., EDIFACT) requires further setup.
- Assumes `main.js` and `styles.css` exist; implement as needed.
- Test thoroughly (unit, integration, security, performance).
